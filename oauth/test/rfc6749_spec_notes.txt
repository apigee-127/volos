RFC 6749 Spec Notes

Legend:
/ = tested
x = cannot (or will not) be tested
  = open item

2. Client Registration
x When registering a client, the client developer SHALL:
x  specify the client type (2.1)
x  provide its client redirection URIs (3.1.2)
x  include any other information required by the server
x    (e.g., application name, website, description, logo image, the acceptance of legal terms)

2.1 Client Types
x confidential: protocol and keys can be secreted
x public: protocol and keys may be compromised

2.2 Client Identifier
x server issues the registered client a client identifier (not secret)
x server SHOULD document the size of any identifier it issues

2.3 Client Authentication
x server MAY accept any form of (confidential) client authentication meeting its security requirements
x server MAY establish a client authentication method with public clients
/ server MUST NOT rely on public client authentication for the purpose of identifying the (public) client
/ client MUST NOT use more than one authentication method in each request

2.3.1 Client Password
/ server MUST support the HTTP Basic authentication scheme for authenticating clients that were issued a client password
x server MAY support including the client credentials in the request-body (NOT RECOMMENDED)
x   SHOULD be limited to clients unable to directly utilize the HTTP Basic authentication / other password auth
/   parameters MUST NOT be included in the request URI
x server MUST require the use of TLS when sending requests using password authentication
server MUST protect any endpoint utilizing it against brute force attacks

3. Protocol Endpoints
x Authorization endpoint - used to obtain authorization from the resource owner via user-agent redirection
x Token endpoint - used to exchange an authorization grant for an access token
x Redirection (client) endpoint - client endpoint used by the authorization server to return authorization credentials to the client via the resource owner user-agent


3.1 Authorization Endpoint
/ server MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner. (method unspecified)
x Location specified in documentation
x Endpoint URI MAY include query component
x   which MUST be retained,
x   but MUST NOT include a fragment
x server MUST require the use of TLS
/ server MUST support the use of GET for the authorization endpoint,
x server MAY support POST
/ Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were omitted
/ authorization server MUST ignore unrecognized request parameters
/ Request and response parameters MUST NOT be included more than once

3.1.1 Response Type
/ response_type MUST exist and be "code" or "token"
x  (or registered extension - space-delimited commutative values)

3.1.2 Redirection Endpoint
endpoint URI MUST be an absolute URI
endpoint URI MAY include query component which MUST be retained
endpoint MUST NOT include a fragment

3.1.2.1
x redirection endpoint SHOULD require the use of TLS when response_type = "code" or "token"
  (or when the redirection request will result in the transmission of sensitive credentials over an open network)
x if to TLS, the authorization server SHOULD warn the resource owner about the insecure endpoint prior to redirection

3.1.2.2
server MUST require public and confidential clients utilizing implicit grants to register their endpoints
x server SHOULD require all clients to register their redirection endpoint prior to utilizing the authorization
/ server SHOULD require the client to provide the complete redirection URI
x   (client MAY use the "state" request parameter to achieve per-request customization)
x else, the authorization server SHOULD require the registration of the URI scheme, authority, and path
x  (allowing the client to dynamically vary only the query component)
server MAY allow the client to register multiple redirection endpoints

3.1.2.3 Dynamic Configuration
If multiple redirection URIs, only part of the URI, or if no redirection URI has been registered
  the client MUST include a redirection URI with the authorization request using the "redirect_uri" request parameter
When a redirection URI is included, authorization server MUST compare and match the value received against at least one of the registered redirection URIs (or URI components) as defined in [RFC3986] Section 6, if any redirection URIs were registered. If the client registration included the full redirection URI, the authorization server MUST compare the two URIs using simple string comparison as defined in [RFC3986] Section 6.2.1.

/ Request and response parameters MUST NOT be included more than once

3.2.1 Client Authentication
/ client MUST authenticate with the server
/ In the "authorization_code" "grant_type" request to the token endpoint, an unauthenticated client MUST send its "client_id"

3.3 Access Token Scope
x server MAY fully or partially ignore the scope requested
/ If the issued scope is different from the one requested, the server MUST include the "scope" response parameter
/ if client omits scope, server MUST either use a pre-defined default
/   or fail the request indicating an invalid scope
x server SHOULD document its scope requirements and default value (if defined)
